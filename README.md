Project Overview
Airline delays are a critical issue for both airlines and passengers. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can help airlines and airport authorities understand the factors contributing to delays and take proactive measures to minimize their occurrence.

The model is built using a deep neural network (DNN) trained on a dataset of historical airline delay causes, with features such as weather conditions, carrier delays, and airport-specific data.


##### Install the required dependencies:
Make sure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed:


pip install tensorflow keras
Usage
Prepare your dataset (CSV file). In this project, the Airline_Delay_Cause.csv dataset is used.

Open the Jupyter notebook:


jupyter notebook DNN.ipynb
Run the cells step-by-step to load the data, preprocess it, and build the DNN model.

Modify the code to suit your own dataset or analysis goals.

###### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Airline_Delay_Cause.csv, which contains 318,017 records. The features in the dataset include:

year: The year of the flight
month: The month of the flight
arr_flights: Number of arriving flights
arr_del15: Arrival delay of 15 minutes or more
carrier_ct: Delay caused by carrier
weather_ct: Delay caused by weather
security_ct: Delay caused by security
late_aircraft_ct: Delay caused by late aircraft
And more...
Model
The DNN model is built using Keras and TensorFlow. The following steps are included:

Data Preprocessing: Drop unnecessary columns (carrier, carrier_name, airport, airport_name), and handle missing values.

Model Architecture: The model is defined using Keras Sequential API, with layers suited for predicting delay causes based on the input features.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using AdamW optimizer, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are tracked to assess performance.
